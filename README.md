Welcome to UP20 slideshow. 

### UP20 is an opensource marketplace for social program.

The purpose of the UP20 repo is to share workplans, workflows, documents and insights around social programs.

To overcome the digital divide is a global challenge we're facing - 
and we can do it by sharing the best information, knowledge and inspiration.

Our goal is simple - share best-practices, knowledge, workflows, even FULL Programs, with other social activators.
IF it's good - someone will appreciate it! so why not. let's do it. sharing is caring. 

_If you believe your program is great share it! that's it._

## UP20 is a marketplace for social programs
Our logic being that if someone, or NGO, has already created a social program from start-to-finish, 
then it would be possible to share the knowledge for the benefit of other project addressing the same issues.

This repository will be used during the different activities that we're co-creating.
